       <h4>What is a fashion newsletter?</h4><br>
       <p>
        A newsletter is a regularly distributed publication generally about one main topic that is of interest to its subscribers.  In the past, news letters were sent out in paper format by mail to people that wished to receive them.  Since the birth of the internet, more and more newsletters are being sent electronically.  Newsletters delivered electronically via email are some times referenced as e-Newsletters.  However, they are often simply referenced as newsletters because people now understand that they are typically sent electronically.  The electronic newsletter has gained rapid acceptance for the same reasons email in general is gaining popularity over printed correspondence.  Newsletters are published by associations, religious organizations, societies, clubs, and businesses.  They are also occasionally used for other reasons such as family correspondence for holidays or special events.  

        A fashion newsletter can be used by a clothing company to provide information of interest to their customers or employees.  Some newsletters are created as money-making ventures and sold directly to subscribers. Sending newsletters to customers and prospects is a common fashion marketing strategy, which can have benefits and drawbacks.
        
        Many apparel companies provide a newsletter.   Often times, clothing stores, fashion designers, apparel wholesalers, etc., will inform people regarding company news by issuing a newsletter.  In fact, Apparel Search even has a fashion newsletter (we use it on rare occasion). 
        
        When companies have a website, they may add a method to join the mailing list some where on their site.  For example, you can find a link to our mailing list at the bottom of this page (a link that says "newsletter").  If you are looking for a method to join on a particular website and can not seem to find it, you should contact the company and ask if they offer such a service.  Some clothing companies do and others do not.
