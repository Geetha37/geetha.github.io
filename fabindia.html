    <p>Fabindia (or Fabindia Overseas Pvt. Ltd.) is an Indian chain store retailing garments, furnishings, fabrics and ethnic products handmade by craftspeople across rural India.
        <br> Established in 1960 by John Bissell, an American working for the Ford Foundation, New Delhi, Fabindia started out exporting home furnishings, before stepping into domestic retail in 1976, when it opened its first retail store in Greater Kailash, New Delhi.<br>
         Today it has over 250 stores across India and abroad, and is managed by his son, William Nanda Bissell.<br>
     In 2008, Fabindia had a revenue of $65 million, a 30% increase from the previous year.<br>
      Fabindia sources its product from across India through 17 community-owned companies; a certain percentage of the shares of which are held by artisans and craftpersons.<br>
        The products of Fabindia are mainly sourced from villages helping to provide and sustain rural employment in India.<br> 
        They are currently produced by over 40,000 artisans and craftspeople across India.<br>
        The hand-crafted products also encourage good craftsmanship.</p>
