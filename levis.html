    <p>Levi Strauss started the business at the 90 Sacramento Street address in San Francisco and then moved the location to 62 Sacramento Street.<br>
         In 1858, the company was listed as Strauss, Levi (David Stern & Levis Strauss) importers clothing etc.<br>
          63 & 65 Sacramento St. (Today, on the current grounds of the 353 Sacramento street Lobby ) in the San Francisco Directory with Strauss serving as its sales manager and his brother-in-law, David Stern, as its manager.<br>
          Jacob Davis, a Latvian Jewish immigrant, was a Reno, Nevada tailor who frequently purchased bolts of cloth made from denim from Levi Strauss & Co.'s wholesale house.<br>
           After one of Davis' customers kept purchasing cloth to reinforce torn pants, he had an idea to use copper rivets to reinforce the points of strain, such as on the pocket corners and at the base of the button fly.<br>
            Davis did not have the required money to purchase a patent, so he wrote to Strauss suggesting that they go into business together.<br>
             After Levi accepted Jacob's offer, on May 20, 1873, the two men received U.S. Patent 139,121 from the United States Patent and Trademark Office.<br>
              The patented rivet was later incorporated into the company's jean design and advertisements.<br>
               Contrary to an advertising campaign suggesting that Levi Strauss sold his first jeans to gold miners during the California Gold Rush (which peaked in 1849), the manufacturing of denim overalls only began in the 1870s.<br>
                The company created their first pair of Levi's 501 Jeans in the 1890s.</p>
